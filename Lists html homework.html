                A list is an abstract data type that describes a linear collection of data items in some order, in that each element occupies a specific position in the list.
                The order could be alphabetic or numeric or it could just be the order in which the list elements have been added. Unlike a set, the elements of a list do not
                need to be unique. The elements are accessed using an index with the starting position being 0.

                Lists are used in a wide variety of situations. Many of us use to-do lists to keep ourselves organised. You may use a shopping list to make sure you donâ€™t 
                forget to buy something when you visit the supermarket. If you use a streamed music service, you probably have several playlists.

                In pseudocode, lists are indexed starting with 0. That means the first item in the list has index 0, the second item in the list has index 1, and so on, up to the last item, whose index is the list's size minus 1.<br><br>
                In this context, a <i>list</i> is to be understood as a resizable array of items, not as a linked list.<br><br>
                A list can be expressed by wrapping items in brackets; for example, [0, 1, 2] is a three-item list.<br><br>
                NewList() or [] creates a new empty list.<br>
                AddItem(list, item) adds the item "item" to the list "list".<br>
                size(list) returns the size of the list "list".<br>
                list[k] refers to the item at index k of the list "list".<br>
                GetNextLine(file) is a method that gets the next line from a file, or returns nothing if the end of the file was reached.<br>
